# ABSTRACT

Swarm of biological species exhibits a variety of simple individual characteristics which collectively give rise to complex behaviors such as group formation and
transportation.A Decentralized control-based algorithm is presented wherein using each robot in the swarm uses local control rules to exhibit different
behavior that results in collective transportation. On the basis of this implicit coordination through applying force towards
the same direction the robot swarm successfully manipulates the object to the goal location.
