description: The project is based on robot grasping- to develop a grasping mechanism which minimizes the time needed for the robot 
             exoskeleton to be worn by the patient, and can adapt to different body shapes and sizes, even during walking. This avoids the use of conventional 
             straps which are rigid and make the system cumbersome.
