# **About Me**

Hi I am **YASH PATEL** :wave:,<br>
I am a Robotics graduate student at NYU. Before joining NYU, I was fortunate to work at <a href="https://minro.org/" target="_top">Machine Intelligence and Robotics Center (MINRO)</a>, IIIT-Banglore, India under the guidance of <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/sachit-rao/?name=sachitrao" target="_top">Prof. Sachit Rao</a>.<br />

Prior to joining MINRO,IIIT-B, I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics from SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST), India. While pursuing my bachelor's degree at  SRMIST I worked in <a href="https://www.srmteamrobocon.com/" target="_top">SRM Team Robocon</a> in the Mechanical and Systems Integration Domain, where I led domain for 2 years. During my final year I did my Bachelor Project on "Decentralized Control of Robot Swarm for Cooperative Transportation" at <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Autonomous-Systems-Lab-Sivanathan-Kandhasamy" target="_top">Autonomous Systems Lab</a>  under the supervision of Prof. K Sivanathan.
