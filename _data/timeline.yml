  description: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for Autonomous Navigation - 
               A NeRF is a feed-forward neural network trained to reproduce input views 
               of a single scene using a rendering loss. The network directly maps from 
               spatial location and viewing direction to color and opacity, acting as 
               the “volume”. By rendering the volume, we can differentiably render new views. 
               The goal of this project is to first explore neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to 
               build indoor real-world environments and then navigate them using a quadrotor 
               in augmented reality fashion.

  description: My work was in collaboration with <a href="http://www.timetooth.com/" target="_top">TimeTooth Technologies</a>, 
               it involved modelling an adaptive grasping mechanism, that is computing 
               grasp matrix, hand jacobian and contact forces for the purpose of grasp planning and
               analysing grasp singularities to derive an optimal grasp quality.
               I also developed obstacle avoidance based on collision cones and formation control
               algorithms for swarm robotics using quanser autonomos vehicles studio (Motion Capture System).

  description: I worked in the area of mobile robotics. I participated at WRO 2018 competition
               in collaboration with SRM Team Robocon. I also conducted my bachelor thesis
               titled- Decentalized Control of Robot Swarm for Cooperative Transportation, developing a
               decentralized control algorithm using local control of the robots.
