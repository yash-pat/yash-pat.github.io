  description: My work involved modelling an adaptive grasping mechanism that is 
               to be attached on a robotic exoskeleton to grasp the foot, lower limb, 
               chest of a patient with industrial collaborators - <a href="http://www.timetooth.com/" target="_top">TimeTooth Technologies</a>.
               Parallely I also developed obstacle avoidance and formation control
               algorithms for swarm robotics using quanser autonomos vehicles studio (Motion Capture System).
